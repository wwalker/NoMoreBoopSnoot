## Information Presentation

* How to present obstacle distance, closure rate, and impact imminent information to a blind dog such that he can understand?  Or, alternatively, what terms would I use to search for research or data for myself?

I don't understand the psychology(?) of training/learning, especially as it applies to non-primate animals (no understanding of speech); so, I'm looking for help figuring this out.

NoMoreBoopSnoot can gather three different pieces of information (for each of front, left, and right):

* distance to obstacle
* closure rate (as either the dog, the obstacle of both could be moving)
* impact imminent

My conundrum is how to best provide this information to the dog.  My current methods under consideration are either haptic or sonic; however, I am open to any other methods.  While my dog still hears fairly well, many blind dogs are old and have significant hearing loss (or are even also deaf :-( ); therefore, I am leaning towards haptic.  Additionally, haptic feedback could be provided in different locations on the body, in order to provide different information channels.

Haptic feedback would be provided by 3 or more vibration motors similar to those found in cell phones.  It is also much easier to provide multiple channels of information (frontal obstacles, left side obstacles, right side obstacles).

Sonic feedback would be provided by normal tweeters, ultrasonic tweeters, and / or ultrasonic transducers.

For either one I can generate a pulse train and or modulate volume/vibration-strength

Currently, I expect to use 4 or more distance detectors.  Two will be to detect frontal obstacles (together), then 1 or more on each side to detect side obstacles.
